	Overall
	- Wrap exceptions and return something more meaningful to the client (response error codes with message)

	Hotels
	- Add auto-generated hotels at the beggining
	- Use DTOs to hide information like IDs from DB, and generate IDs that clients can use
	- Support images but don't store image in database, store image on filesystem and keep URI to the file in database
	- Support geolocations by adding new class Geolocation that would have lat long attributes
	- Add validation for unique hotel/address
	- Add pagination support when searching hotels

	Users
	- Add Spring Security for registering/authenticating users
	- When user is authenticated get a token, then use that in HTTP calls (e.g. Postman scripts) in order to have access
	- Hash password before storing in DB
	- Add client message when credentials are incorrect

	Accounts and Hotels
	- Fix id generate issue

	Unit tests
	- Once validations are added for hotels/users unit tests should verify that only valid objects are passing validations111
